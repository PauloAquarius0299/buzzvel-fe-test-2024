# Buzzvel teste 2024 
Software Developer Position Test - Buzzvel, with Next.js, React.js, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript
## Introduction
Following the Figma design layout, I developed an animated, intuitive interface using Next.js as the primary framework. This choice leverages its pre-configured libraries, allowing for efficient building and reuse of React components throughout the development process, as well as the ability to utilize 'use client' (SSR) for modules that need client-side execution. TypeScript brings static typing (explicitly defining variable types, function parameters, and returns) to the software, contributing to a more robust and secure codebase. TailwindCSS streamlines the development process with a modern approach, allowing predefined colors and spacing from the projectâ€™s start. Its capacity to style directly within HTML tags adds efficiency to the workflow and enables the use of semantic HTML for SEO best practices.
Libraries Installed:
* Embla-Carousel: to create a dynamic, interactive customer feedback slider component
* Framer-Motion: used for adding animations and user interaction elements, enhancing user experience with the platform

# This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
